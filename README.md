# Tougher-Gun-Repair-GAMMA
 Makes gun repair more difficult. Designed for GAMMA 0.9.3

# Goals
- Keep GAMMA 0.9.3's "no overall gun condition" idea
 - Keep the focus on repair kits and cleaning kits as the key items for fixing weapons
 - Make part swapping (as in, fixing parts outside of the gun, then replacing the parts via field strip/workbench) a viable alternative to repairing parts inside the guns ("in-gun repair")
 - Make repair kits and cleaning kits more difficult to obtain
 - Make gun repair a longer process that requires more inputs (in the form of crafting items or money) to fix a gun
 - (possible stretch goal) Bring gun repair more in line with armor repair, or vice versa
